# Java Voronoi

This Java code creates 2D Voronoi diagrams including the traversable output graph of site polygons, edges, and vertices. Can be used for delauney triangulation as well.

## In Action

Here is a gif created by the project's test.gpergrossi.tools.VoronoiAnimationGenerator class using the input 
```
svg f arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf
```
(svg means **S**mall, **V**erbose, use a **G**rid to generate initial points)
(arf means **A**dd point, **R**elax, render **F**rame)
