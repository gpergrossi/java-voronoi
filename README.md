# Java Voronoi

This Java code creates 2D Voronoi diagrams including the traversable output graph of site polygons, edges, and vertices. Can be used for delauney triangulation as well.

## In Action

Here is a gif created by the project's test.gpergrossi.tools.VoronoiAnimationGenerator class using the input 
```
svg f arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf arf
```
The letters stand for:<br/>
**S**mall<br/>
**V**erbose (level 1)<br/>
**G**rid used to generate initial points<br/>
**A**dd point<br/>
**R**elax<br/>
**F**rame rendered to gif file<br/>

## Usage

1. Download the source code
2. Compile and run one of the following classes from test.gpergrossi.tools:
   - InfiniteVoronoi
      - scroll and pan with scroll wheel/middle click
   - VoronoiAnimationGenerator (seen above)
      - instructions shown when running
   - VoronoiTestView 
      - left click in the pentagon to place points
      - right click to delete
      - space to step through the algorithm
      - enter to finish the diagram
3. The test cases in test.gpergrossi.util use JUnit 5 (other versions will probably be fine too).

Look at the source code for VoronoiTestView to get an idea of how diagrams are constructed. Explore the voronoi classes for more information. Sorry this isn't documented yet! I am using this code for my personal projects. I wrote all of it (except the gif saver), but I did not clean it up for others to use.

## Pull Requests

If I get any I will - of course - look at them and potentially include them. I would love to work toward making this code a reliable and useful tool to as many programmers as possible. That said, I've seen other Fortune's algorithm implementations in java on github that are probably better than mine.
