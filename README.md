# Java Voronoi

This Java code creates 2D Voronoi diagrams including the traversable output graph of site polygons, edges, and vertices. Can be used for delauney triangulation as well.

## In Action

Here is a gif created by the project's test.gpergrossi.tools.VoronoiAnimationGenerator class using the input 
```

The letters stand for:<br/>
